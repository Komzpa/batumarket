Ontology output files.

Generated by running `make ontology` or `python src/scan_ontology.py`. JSON files
record field usage statistics and help refine prompts. They are tracked in git
so changes to the dataset are versioned over time.
If the `data/raw` directory is absent skip running the script – it would
overwrite the existing files with empty data.

The directory contains:

- `fields.json` – all keys and values with usage counts.
- `fields.approved.json` – curated list of canonical fields. Each entry is an
  object with a tag `key`, its English description and a list of example
  `values`.
- `misparsed.json` – lots that failed validation together with the text fed
  into the parser.
- `fraud.json` – lots flagged with a `fraud` field and the matching input.
- `broken_meta.json` – references to raw messages that need to be re-fetched
  due to missing metadata.
- `title_*.json` and `description_*.json` – lists of unique text per language
  for manual review.
